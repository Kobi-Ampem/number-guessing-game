#  Number Guessing Game

A simple and interactive number guessing game written in Python, where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100 within 10 attempts.

---

##  How It Works

- The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
- The user is given **10 attempts** to guess the correct number.
- After each guess, the game will inform the player if the guess is:
  -  Too high
  -  Too low
  -  Correct!
- The game provides helpful error handling for invalid inputs (like typing a string instead of a number).
- After the game ends, the user is given the option to **play again**.
